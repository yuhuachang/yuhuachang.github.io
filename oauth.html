    Conclusion:
    It seems to be very simple to use.
    It does not work with AAD.

4.  Run test server on port 80 instead of port 3000
    [Discussion] https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1083

    To use create-react-app to create a React.js application is easy.
    After application is created, we can use "npm start" to start a webpack-dev-server on port 3000.
    If we want to change it to a different port, we need to modify package.json:
      "scripts": {
        "start": "cross-env PORT=80 react-scripts start",
        ...
    And to have it works, we need to "npm install cross-env --save" first.
    To sum up, we set the environment variable (unix style) PORT to tell dev server which port to use.
    This only works in Unix so we use cross-env package to let it work in Windows.

5.  Make Spring-Boot to accept token.

    [Tutorial] https://auth0.com/blog/securing-spring-boot-with-jwts/
    [Github] https://github.com/DylanMeeus/springboot_jwt_blog

6.  We got "Response for preflight is invalid" error in ajax call.

    The ajax call first attempt to send an OPTIONS message (the preflight message) to the server
    to validate if this resource is safe before sending actual request with security token.

    The preflight method should be OPTIONS and headers look like this (and their requirements):

        Host: localhost
        Connection: keep-alive
        Access-Control-Request-Method: GET <---------------------- should not be null
        Origin: http://localhost:3000 <--------------------------- should not be null
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win...
        Access-Control-Request-Headers: authorization
        Accept: */*
        Referer: http://localhost:3000/
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
        Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,zh-CN;q=0.6,zh-TW;q=0.4

    We see it is sent to spring-boot api server but somehow, it is not processed as preflight message.

    Adding @CrossOrigin in controller will allow CORS call but it doesn't seem to be this problem.

    [Ref] https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework
    [Ref] http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/cors.html

    Here is the test:
        1) Use Spring Security but in WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, leave configure empty,
           which means, no protection.

                @Override
                protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { }

           This will work.

        2) Add one line in configurate, to protect all resources:
        
                http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated();

           It show the error:
                Fetch API cannot load http://localhost/firefighter/customers.
                Redirect from 'http://localhost/firefighter/customers' to 'http://localhost/login'
                has been blocked by CORS policy: Request requires preflight, which is disallowed to 
                follow cross-origin redirect.

           Check the server, we see a request method OPTIONS is blocked.

        3) Add a CorsFilter like this:

                public class CorsFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
                    @Override
                    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {
                        if ("OPTIONS".equals(request.getMethod())) {
                            response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
                            response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
                            response.setHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "3600");
                            response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "authorization, content-type, xsrf-token");
                            response.addHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers", "xsrf-token");
                            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
                        } else {
                            filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
                        }
                    }
                }

           And add it:

                http.addFilterBefore(new CorsFilter(), ChannelProcessingFilter.class);

        4) Check the server, we see the request header:

                Host: localhost
                Connection: keep-alive
                User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Wi...
                Origin: http://localhost:3000
                authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiI...
                Accept: */*
                Referer: http://localhost:3000/
                Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
                Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,zh-CN;q=0.6,zh-TW;q=0.4
                ]

           So out token did arrive the server side.
           Now the question is to use that token and authorize the request.

7.  Now we have our front-end to use AzureAD and can acquire a valid JWT token.
    We also be able to let front-end send this token in "Authority" section in http header.
    We can retrieve this token from the http request in our back-end.
    Now we want to retrieve the information in this token and verify it.

    Base on this article https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims
    The JWT token issued by AzureAD is encoded in RSA 256.
    
    We should go to here: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration
    and check the value of "jwks_uri",
    which is "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys"
    and check "kid" value in our JWT header...
    (We can manually decode JWT token at https://jwt.io/ by copy'n'paste)
    to select the public key used to sign this token.
    (There are about three keys which are rotated about everyday.)
